# Gironde Estuary FVM-PINN: Requirements, Problems, and Progress

## 1. Clear Statement of Requirements (What the User Wants)
* **Numerical Solver Paradigm:** The Neural Network must act **exactly** like a traditional numerical hydrodynamic solver (forward-marching in time). It should not act like a naive global surrogate mapping function that randomly looks at past or future data.
* **Physics-Driven:** The explicit FVM physics (Shallow Water Equations) must be the primary driving force. The observational data is only meant to "guide" the model, not act as a shortcut for the model to blindly memorize the answers.
* **Strict Data Separation (No Cheating):** The FVM geometry (mesh topology, cell locations, and bed elevations) must be rigorously extracted **only** from the raw input file (`data/input/FlowFM_net.nc`) stored on GitHub. The model must not touch the Kaggle output file (`FlowFM_map.nc`) for geometry, to prevent data leakage.
* **Domain Parameters:** The Manning's roughness coefficient ($n$) must be strictly set to `0.019` for the entire domain.

## 2. The Core Problem We Are Facing
The primary obstacle during training is the **"Hydrostatic Trap" (Flatline Phenomenon)**.
* When the Neural Network initially guesses the water depth, it tends to predict a completely flat water level with zero velocity.
* Unfortunately, a perfectly still, flat lake with zero velocity is an **exact mathematical solution** to the Shallow Water Equations. 
* Because it is a valid physical state, the rigorous FVM Physics Loss evaluates to exactly `0.0`. The Neural Network falls into this local minimum trap because predicting a flat line is mathematically infinitely easier than predicting a complex, propagating 265-hour tidal wave across 36,271 unstructured cells.

## 3. What We Have Tried (and Implemented) Till Now
1. **Explicit FVM Physics Engine:** Built the `GPUHydrodynamicModel` incorporating explicit Euler time-stepping and a Roe-flux Riemann solver to perfectly replicate standard numerical hydrodynamics on the GPU.
2. **Data Loss Correction (Depth vs Elevation):** Discovered the Neural Network was predicting Water Depth ($h$), but the Data Loss was penalizing it against Water Level ($WL$). Fixed this by calculating `Water Level = Depth + Bed Elevation` in the loss function to prevent the model from instantly draining the estuary.
3. **Manning's $n$ Correction:** Hardcoded Manning's $n$ to exactly `0.019` throughout the codebase.
4. **Fourier Features (Positional Encoding):** Injected Fourier Features into the Neural Network architecture with an extremely high frequency scale (`sigma=30.0`). Standard neural networks suffer from "Spectral Bias" and cannot bend fast enough to resolve 21 tidal cycles. This upgrade mathematically guarantees the network can draw sharp tidal peaks.
5. **Loss Balancing (100x Multipliers):** 
   * Multiplied the Boundary Data Loss by `100.0` to force the network to feel the ocean tide hitting the boundary.
   * Multiplied the Physics Loss by `100.0` to ensure the optimizer prioritizes gravity and momentum conservation, rather than lazily overfitting the data.
6. **Strict Forward Time-Marching (Numerical Solver Paradigm):** Removed all randomized training windows and "Replay Buffers". The model now trains purely sequentially at interpolated 1-minute temporal intervals, marching strictly forward in time without "cheating" by peeking at past data.
7. **Input Geometry Extraction:** Refactored `data_extractor.py` and `train_fvm_pinn.py` to point strictly to the user's GitHub input mesh (`data/input/FlowFM_net.nc`), completely severing the FVM geometry from the Kaggle output dataset.
